# lrpi_rclone

This LushRoom Pi module provides a docker container that synchronises the media files for the LushRoom Pi sound and light media player.

For it to work, an `rclone_lushrooms.conf` (configuration file) and a `lushroom-rclone.json` (Google Drive or Team Drive credentials file) must be placed in a USB stick mounted to the docker host.
